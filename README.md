# Monopoly Simulation using R
 This project implements a simulation of a popular board game using R programming language. It simulates the movement of players on the game board, including actions such as rolling dice, drawing chance and community chest cards, and handling special spaces like "Go to Jail" and "Free Parking". The simulation tracks the frequency of landing on each space on the game board and provides a visualization of the results using a histogram. The code is organized into classes for Dice, Player, and a tracking mechanism to record landing frequencies. Additionally, it includes datasets for Chance and Community Chest cards, as well as the game board layout. This project serves as an educational example of object-oriented programming in R and simulation techniques.
